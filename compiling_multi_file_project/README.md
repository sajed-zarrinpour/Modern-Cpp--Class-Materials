In this project, I want to express the compiling procedure of a multi file project. 
The order you shall read is:
1. compiling from terminal (go to terminal folder)
2. compiling with make (go to make file folder)
3. compiling with cmake (go to cmake folder)
That is, if you want to understand it better. Skip each step as approperiate.
