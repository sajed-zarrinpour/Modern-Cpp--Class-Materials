To automate compiling, we use *Makefile*s. Each Makefile can contain instructions for 4 steps:

1. building binaries (make)
2. executing binaries (make exec)
3. installing binaries (make install)
4. removing binaries (make clean)

Here, we are trying to keep things simple. And I dont intended to discuss the 3rd step.
